Hyperspectral data provide a lot of information for the remote discrimination of ground truth, however, since spectral dimensions were many, the possibility of information redundancy is presented. Data analysis and interpretation of hyperspectral images can also be a challenge.

The goal of the group assignmnet was to exploit the tools for machine learning to analyze hyperspectral images of Indian pine fields to provide information for remote discrimination of subtle differences in the ground truth.

Exploratory Data analysis of our choice focused on, first understanding the dataset probing the overall description of the dataset. Pixel sizes contained in 200 bands of image were analyzed for the presence of redundancy of the information they all held. This was achieved through the assesment of interband correlation. Of the first 15 bands, band1 had the weakest correlation with the remainig bands (bands2-band15), showing a very strong correlation between band2 to 15 with coefficients ranging between 0.7 to 0.9 in most combinations. 
The correlation co-efficints of the bands with the class (specie) column was analyzed. The highest correlation coefficient was estimated to be ~ 0.23. Selected Bands with Correlation Coefficient >= 0.238 with the Class (Specie) Column were as follows:

| Band ID | Correlation Coefficient with the Class Column |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| band147 | 0.245247                                     |
| band148 | 0.245009                                     |
| band149 | 0.242812                                     |
| band150 | 0.242855                                     |
| band151 | 0.238947                                     |
| band153 | 0.238003                                     |
| band155 | 0.239565                                     |
| band184 | 0.238006                                     |
| band185 | 0.241086                                     |
| band188 | 0.238426                                     |
| band190 | 0.239321                                     |
| band191 | 0.238504                                     |
| band192 | 0.239755                                     |
| band193 | 0.241024                                     |
| band194 | 0.242920                                     |
| band195 | 0.238310                                     |
| band196 | 0.240277                                     |


It was obvious that these bands were strongly correlated as well, hence any two of them, could most probably be used to train an algorithm to make predictions.

In supervised learning, a training data set consisting of inputâ€“output pairs is available, and a Machine Learning algorithm is trained with the goal of providing predictions of the desired output for unseen input values.
